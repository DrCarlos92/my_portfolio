### Procrastination problems

I'll be honest. A few months ago, I didn't really care about a blog or building websites and quite frankly, none of my friends did either. In fact, they dont even know I do this stuff. Once this blog goes live, I plan to drop the biggest bombshell in the group chat since Florentino Perez announced the now seemingly defunct European Super League. Well...not that big but you get the idea. I already have my wife asking me to create one for her too and judging by the amount of side hustles people are getting in to on Instagram, she probably isnt the only one with the same idea. So why now?

Like many others during the Covid-19 lockdown, I needed to find an outlet. The first lockdown in the UK (March 2020) involved a glutinous cycle of working from home, trading CFDs and playing *Call of Duty - Warzone* or *Grand Theft Auto V* with my friends. That cycle was on repeat. I loved it though for the first few weeks but alas, too much of a good thing is a bad thing. I've always needed something to keep me active since I was a kid. I was that kid who played out so much, that my mum never let me go out again after coming in for a sip of water. That kid still lives inside, although his definitely not the reason why I gained a few pounds during lockdown too. I have *JustEat* and my temporary lack of will power to thank for that. 

So when the second lockdown came in November of the same year and after Rishi Sunaks ploy to get people to spend lots and lots at restaurants during the summer (it worked like a charm for me btw), I was back to square one. Then it really hit me. I just finished an episode of *The Crown* with my laptop open when I saw one of those pesky advertisements about changing career paths to a UX designer. Im guessing my cookies were shared as a few days before I was researching roles in Blockchain. It reminded of why I chose the career path I did. I had enough of just sitting unproductively at home with miserable weather all day. So i researched how to make a website for fun, and therefore, a jekyll blog. 

### print "Hello World"

I actually started coding in 2016 when I learnt Python to an immediate level so I can build an app. That was also a time of desolate activities, mainly because I was quite broke at the time because I was in the middle of a property purchase and I couldnt even afford to socialise. Unfortunately, my life then became so busy that I couldnt carry it on further. While working at Boeing, a couple year later I realised that I wanted to do Technical Writing but for software. Learning Python tapped in to problem solving skills I hadnt used in years, and it was briliant. I thought, "What if I did my job, but for software instead of planes?" and that's how I got here. 

Eventually when the busy life slowed down finally, the thoughts of moving toward software returned. While at Boeing, I was doing so much work using HTML and XML. I started experimenting different ways of doing my jobs and at times, cutting down an 8 hour task to 2 hours using VBA. It was only a matter of time till I had to make a decision. 

### Blue pill or red pill

First, I had to either transfer roles in Boeing or leave to a tech company. Unfortunately, the latter had to happen leaving behind fantastic colleagues. I'm now working at Ocado Technology, the first online grocery store in the world. The growth here has been exponential. Its so busy with new clients and new projects. Since joining, the share price has nearly tripled. I knew by being here and immersing myself with tech is what I needed to do.

Thats not the conclusion though as even experience here can be quite limiting. Fast forward back to the second lockdown and thats where I decided to do some extra stuff. I learnt how to do Open API spec documents and I've also created this site using Jekyll. Now if youre reading this, this is my first attempt at a blog so dont judge too harsh. This blog is aimed for any professionals who would like to connect but also want to see me for who I am, future employers with the intention of the same thing or ofcourse anyone who just generally wants to know more about me. I have a squirm like reaction when asked to write about myself so that dont help, but, I kind of realised this blog building stuff is a great way to express oneself also and can honestly say its been fun.

90% of my online learning of either coding or blog building was learnt via YouTube. I have to give them a shoutout because they really are the MVPs. Plus, you might want to know where I learnt it all. I have learnt so much in the last few months from that platform. I believe that today, the greatest thing to come out of the internet in the last 20 years is not ebay, Amazon, Spotify, Facebook. Nope. Its YouTube. I have a friend who is step by step converting his loft, using YouTube tutorials after renovating his bathroom doing the same thing. I myself have learnt the basics of Jekyll and blog building using the minima theme. It has also answered many troubleshooting questions about CSS, HTML, YAML etc. Obviously I was using a lot of Stack Overflow too and in general, I found myself problem solving using a lot research and I liked it. I now find myself spending hours trying to debug a script or investigating why something isnt paginating in a certain way.
